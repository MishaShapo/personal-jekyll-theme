## About

I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science and Math, with a focus on artificial intelligence and data science.
I'm part of the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars) and [Polymathic Scholars](https://cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/polymathic) honors programs.

On campus, I connect ambitious students with experienced mentors as the Partnerships Lead for [Convergent](http://txconvergent.org), the premier product development education organization.
Also, I build communities as an officer in the [Turing Scholars Student Association](https://utexas.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/turingscholarsstudentassociation) and the [Polymathic Student Panel](https://cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/polymathic/current-students/handbook#ps-student-leadership-panel).

Fun fact time! 
- I've been playing soccer for over 15 years!
- I bring my DSLR camera everywhere! [Check out some of my pictures.]()
- I go everywhere on an electric skateboard. Like even to the bathroom.
- I refer to all my significant mentors as _Mom_ or _Dad_ to let them know they're special.
- My reassuring demeanor has earned me the nick-name: _Babushka_. It's Russian for _grandmother_.
- Role models and people I steal ideas/jokes from include [Bo Burnham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdynfVNbJ5E), [John Green](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1406384.John_Green), [Myles Wheeler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyg4QwwQ62s), and [Arjo Mozumder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjomoz/).
