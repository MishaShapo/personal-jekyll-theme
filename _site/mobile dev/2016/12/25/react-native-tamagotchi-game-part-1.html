<h2 id="a-tamagotchi-mobile-health-game">A Tamagotchi Mobile Health Game</h2>
<p>I am writing a series a blog posts as I develop a <strong>Tamagotchi mobile app</strong> for both
the iOS and Android platforms using <strong>React Native</strong>. My hackathon team and I began
this project during the HackTX 2016 hackathon. Now, I am going to finish the
basic functionality and add improvements while writing about the challenges that
I come across and solutions that I create.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-through-gameplay">Exercise Through Gameplay</h3>
<p>We wanted to encourage users to exercise through the use of the Tamagotchi game
mechanic, so our idea was to create a Tamagotchi game where the in-game currency
is earned through <strong>fitness goals</strong> such as walking a certain number of steps every
day.</p>

<p>React Native was the tool of choice because we wanted to learn something new

<h3 id="app-featuresobjectives">App Features/Objectives</h3>
<p>Here is a short list of features I aim to implement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sprites and fluid animations</li>
  <li>inventory and in-game currency</li>
  <li>Google Fit (Android) and HealthKit(iOS) integration</li>
  <li>social media sharing</li>
</ul>

<p>Donâ€™t let the brevity of the list fool you, there is a lot of code behind those
words. The health service integration alone will require platform-specific
<strong>native modules</strong> in order to properly monitor step count data.</p>

plan can be found here.</a></p>

<p>Thank you for reading. Check back in soon, and I will share more about how we
made this app.</p>
